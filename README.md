# CMPE-258-vision-classifiers (ASSIGNMENT 7)


PROBLEM STATEMENT

Do not copy from hint colabs. please type it out and customize it.

Use TPU in colab please.

a) Demonstrate how convolution layers themselves work visually in colab

b) implement depth wise pooling layer in keras and demonstrate its use

c)

Part 2:

Three colabs with vision classifiers - data - mnist, fashion mnist and cifar 10

demonstrate for each colab :

a) use simple neural network as well as lenet-5 - two architectures

b) demonstrate pretrained model with transfer learning (both efficient net and BiT)

c) Demonstrate imge augmentation

d) demonstrate with state of art image models - mlp-mixer

Part 3:

a) Xray pnemonea classification with convnet

b) 3d image classication of ctscan
