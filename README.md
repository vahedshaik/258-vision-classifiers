Part 2:

Three colabs with vision classifiers - data - mnist, fashion mnist and cifar 10

demonstrate for each colab :

a) use simple neural network as well as lenet-5 - two architectures

b) demonstrate pretrained model with transfer learning (both efficient net and BiT)

c) Demonstrate imge augmentation

d) demonstrate with state of art image models - mlp-mixer
